      <h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>
      <p>
HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. Unlike programming languages that have logical conditions or loops, HTML is a markup language; its primary purpose is to describe the structure and presentation of content. When you open a webpage, the text, images, links, tables, and other elements you see are all organized and formatted using HTML.
HTML is based on the concept of elements. These elements represent different parts of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more. Each element tells the browser how to display the content. For instance, a paragraph element ensures that the text appears as a paragraph, with proper spacing before and after.
A basic HTML document has a structure that looks like this: a declaration specifying the HTML version, followed by a root html element, a head section containing metadata (like the page title or character encoding), and a body section containing the content visible to users. Understanding this structure is essential for creating any webpage.
HTML is universal: all modern web browsers understand and render HTML. It serves as the foundation upon which CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript are applied, which are responsible for styling and dynamic behavior respectively.
</p>

<h2 id="a2">HTML Elements and Tags</h2>
<p>
HTML content is composed of elements, and each element is defined using tags. A typical HTML element has an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. For example, <p> This is a paragraph.</p> p represents a paragraph element. The p is the opening tag, p is the closing tag, and the text in between is the content.
Elements can be block-level or inline. Block-level elements, like div, h1-h6, and p, start on a new line and take up the full width available. Inline elements, like span, a, and strong, stay within the flow of the surrounding content without breaking the line.
HTML also includes structural elements that define the layout of the page. Elements like header, footer, nav, section, and article help organize content in a meaningful way, making it easier for users and search engines to understand the webpage. Additionally, semantic elements give context to the content, improving accessibility and SEO.
Nesting is an important concept in HTML, where elements are placed inside other elements. Proper nesting ensures the document is valid and renders correctly in browsers. Improperly nested tags can cause unexpected behavior and layout issues.</p>

<h2 id="a3">HTML Attributes</h2>
<p>
Attributes provide additional information about an element and are always included in the opening tag. They modify the behavior or appearance of elements. An attribute has a name and a value, written as name="value".
Common HTML attributes include:

<ul>
<li>id: Provides a unique identifier for an element, often used for styling or scripting. </li>
<li>class: Groups elements into categories for styling or manipulation.</li>
<li>src: Specifies the source of an image, script, or iframe.</li>
<li>href: Defines the URL for a link element (a tag).</li>
<li>alt: Gives alternative text for images, enhancing accessibility.</li>
<li>title: Offers supplementary information, usually displayed as a tooltip.</li>
</ul>

Attributes can also control form elements, tables, media elements, and more. Some attributes are boolean, meaning they do not need a value, like checked, disabled, or readonly. Proper use of attributes is key to making webpages interactive, accessible, and semantically correct.
</p>
<h2 id="a4">HTML Forms</h2>
<p>
Forms are a critical part of HTML because they allow user input and communication with a server. Forms are created using the form element, which contains various input elements like text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, drop-down lists, and buttons.
Each input element has a type attribute that defines the kind of input it accepts. For example:type="text" for single-line text input


type="password" for confidential text


type="email" for email addresses


type="submit" for form submission


Forms also use the action and method attributes. The action attribute specifies the URL where the form data will be sent, and the method attribute defines how the data will be sent, typically using "GET" or "POST".
HTML forms support other elements like label for accessible labeling, textarea for multi-line input, and select for drop-down options. Properly structured forms are crucial for usability and accessibility, allowing users to interact with websites effectively.

<h2 id="a5">HTML5 New Features</h2>
<p>
HTML5 introduced significant enhancements over previous HTML versions, making it more powerful, semantic, and multimedia-friendly. One major focus was semantic elements such as header, footer, article, section, and aside. These elements improve content structure and accessibility.
HTML5 also provides new form input types like email, date, number, url, and range, allowing browsers to validate user input automatically. Additionally, HTML5 includes new APIs for web applications, including:


Canvas API for drawing graphics


Audio and Video elements for native media playback


Geolocation API for location-based applications


Local Storage for storing data on the client side


Other notable HTML5 features include offline support, drag-and-drop, and improved accessibility features. Overall, HTML5 makes web development more streamlined, interactive, and compatible across modern browsers, giving developers powerful tools to build responsive and rich web applications.
